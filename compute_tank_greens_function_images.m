    % Compute the frequency-domain green's function for a tank using the
    % method of images. The form of the summation used here is derived in: 
    % Allen, J. B., & Berkley, D. A. (1979). Image method for efficiently 
    % simulating small‐room acoustics. The Journal of the Acoustical 
    % Society of America, 65(4), 943-950.
    % (Equation 10, though the sum is done here in the frequency domain
    % instead of the time domain.)
    
    % Inputs:
    % r_source: Vector position of the source (m) [3x1]
    % r_receiver: Vector position of the receiver (m) [3x1]
    % omega: Angular frequencies at which to compute G (radians) [Nx1]
    % Lx, Ly, Lz: Dimensions of the tank in each coordinate (m)
    % c: Sound speed (m/s)
    % beta_wall: Reflection coefficient for the 5 non-surface walls of the
    % tank
    % beta_surface: Reflection coefficient for the water surface
    % cutoff_time: Time over which to sum reflected paths (s) 
    % damping: Constant damping applied which simulates gradual loss of
    % energy, evenly across frequencies, proportional to distance
    % travelled
    
    % Outputs:
    % g_tank: [Nx1] Green's function for propation in the tank between the 
    % source and receiver positions, as a function of the angular 
    % frequencies specified by omega.
    
    % Dependencies: 
    % compute_free_field_greens_function.m
    
    % Source and receiver positions are specified in meters in a coordinate
    % system in which the origin lies at one of the vertices of the tank,
    % and x, y, and z are all increasing into the tank, such that the tank
    % walls lie at x=0, x=Lx, y=0, y=Ly, z=0, and the surface is at z=Lz.
    
    % Every reflected path which arrives before the cutoff time is included
    % in the summation, with time t=0 corresponding to the start of the 
    % signal production at the source. Note that some paths which arrive 
    % after the cutoff time will also be included in the summation, so the
    % output is no longer exact after the cutoff time. Ideally, the cutoff
    % time should be chosen to be sufficiently long such that reflected
    % paths which take longer than this to arrive have been sufficiently
    % dampened as to not contribute meaningfully to the signal measured at
    % the receiver.
